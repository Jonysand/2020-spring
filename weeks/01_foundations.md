# Foundations

<!-- 

Notes 

* Short history of the web?
* Why build web applications? Why to not build web applications? 
* Blogs to follow
* What we are not going to learn in the class
  * list of topics/themes?
  * knowing what you know vs what you don't yet!
* Doing web development vs. working professionally as a developer vs. working professionally as a developer in industry vs. studio, etc
* Conceptual overview of how the web works?
* Overview of terms
* Clarification of terms
  * e.g. server vs platform as a service 
  * e.g. serverside javascript vs serverside XYZ
* The browser and the DOM
* Development tools 
  * git / github
  * text edior (vs code ) 
  * iterm2 or equivalent?
  * glitch account and/or heroku?

* Practice:
  * Git exercise + build a simple webpage
  * connecting github repo to glitch
  
* additional thoughts:
  * thinking about when to build from scratch vs. using templates. 
  * javascript patterns
    * think about state management, not polluting global scope, etc. 
    * e.g. pub-sub, MVC, MVVM, etc
