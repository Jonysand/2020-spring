## Introduction
This week, we will be focusing our attention on the "front-end" of web applications. 


### Outcomes & Goals

In this class we will be:
* Learning about HTML5

Students will walk away with a deeper understanding of:
*  the DOM
*  CSS

This is by no means a comprehensive deep dive into the intricacies and wonders of client side programming with HTML5, single page web applications, and front-end frameworks like Vue.js and React.js or build tools like Parcel and Webpack. Additionally we do not cover browser extensions or bookmarklets which are very exciting, but outside the scope of this course.
