## About

This frontend JavaScript guide is a roadmap to having a solid JavaScript foundation. Like any language, learning JavaScript for the frontend not only means having a strong grasp of the syntax of JavaScript, but also how it works with and applies to other contexts (e.g. interacting with the DOM, communicating with APIs, etc).

# JavaScript Foundations

In this section we cover foundational JavaScript knowledge. Note that we assume some prior exposure to JavaScript in this section.

## Introduction: The Basics

You can skip this section if the following topics are familiar or you have a grasp of these concepts:
1. ✅ [JavaScript Comments, Variables, Data Types, and Hello, World!](https://www.taniarascia.com/javascript-day-one/)
2. ✅ [Understanding Variables, Scope and Hoisting in JavaScript](https://www.taniarascia.com/understanding-variables-scope-hoisting-in-javascript/)
   - Differentiating between: `var`, `const`, and `let`.

# Advanced: JavaScript Patterns

For continued learning, you will start to get into a place where you'll want to develop and eye for and an ability to implement different JavaScript patterns. These software development patterns allow you to handle increasing complexity in your applications such as handling state, managing data, variable and function scoping, and general modularity, scalability, and maintenance of frontend applications. 

There are many JavaScript Patterns that exist and many which are reliant on a firm grasp of [JavaScript Classes]. I can recommend the following references for beginning to understand how JavaScript Patterns can be used in practice to build increasingly complex software:

* [MVC Pattern: Model-view-controller](https://www.taniarascia.com/javascript-mvc-todo-app/)
* [PubSub Pattern: The Publish-Subscribe Pattern]()
  * Examples of the PubSub pattern
    * [a-simple-pubsub-module-in-javascript](https://bdadam.com/blog/a-simple-pubsub-module-in-javascript.html)
    * [pub-sub boilerplate](https://github.com/joeyklee/pubsub-boilerplate)
* [Observer Pattern](https://pawelgrzybek.com/the-observer-pattern-in-javascript-explained/)
* Writing on JS Patterns:
  * Additional patterns are discussed here in [Josh Bedo's JS Design Pattern's Blogpost](https://joshbedo.github.io/JS-Design-Patterns/) 
  * [Observer vs PubSub Pattern](https://hackernoon.com/observer-vs-pub-sub-pattern-50d3b27f838c)

# Advanced: JavaScript Frameworks

At the heart and soul of many JavaScript frameworks is the implementation and application of JavaScript Patterns into a system that allows software to be maintainable and scalable. Many frontend frameworks these days implement some kind of JavaScript pattern like a [MVVM or Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) and [Flux pattern](https://facebook.github.io/flux/).

These days, there are A LOT of front end frameworks out there. 

Below are the cool kids in town these days:

* (My personal recommendation) [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) with [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) ==> [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) which is a framework built in Vue.js
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) with React Hooks or [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) & [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) which is a framework built on React.js

Still relevant and widely used:
 
 * [Backbone.js](https://backbonejs.org/)
 * [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/)

And recent and somehow seems too good to be true:

* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)

## Essential Questions

- How does the web browser work?
- What is the DOM? 
  - Why is it important to use semantically relevant tags instead of just "divs"?
- What are events? What are event listeners?
- How do we handle user inputs using HTML Forms? 
- What are the unique roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?
- What does it mean to be "asynchronous" in development? How and why is this relevant for web development?
- What are JavaScript Array functions and how can they be used to achieve different tasks?

- "Vanilla JavaScript"
- Selecting DOM Elements by DOM type or CSS class or ID
  - Accessing Elements in the DOM: https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-access-elements-in-the-dom/
  - Traversing the DOM: https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-traverse-the-dom/
  - Making Changes to the DOM: https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-make-changes-to-the-dom/
- Event binding / Event firing / listening
- Handling forms (only in the browser)
- `fetch`, AJAX requests
