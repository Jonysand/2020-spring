## About
This week, we will be starting out journey as developers of the web. 

As part of this week's lecture and discussion, we will go through a (very) quick history of the web and define some important concepts and definitions related to the internet and web development. 

A majority of the class will be focused on setting up your development environments and getting you into the practice of developing and deploying web applications through your first assignment.

## Topics
### How the Internet Works
When we're creating websites and web applications, it's helpful to understand the infrastructure of the Internet. This helps us understand all of the steps in creating a website from scratch.

What is the Internet? It's a global network of computers connected to each other. They're not all directly connected to each other, which would look something like this:

<img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8443/internet-schema-2.png" width="300" alt="Naive incorrect Internet diagram" />

Instead, computers are connected to intermediary routers, provided by an Internet Service Provider (ISP), whose only job is to direct messages from one computer to another. 

<img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8453/internet-schema-7.png" alt="Accurate Internet diagram with ISP routers" width="300">

The Internet is different from the World Wide Web (WWW), which is the collection of information that can be accessed via the Internet. You can think of a library building as the Internet, and the books stored in the library as the world wide web.

Each computer has a unique IP (Internet Protocol) address, which you can think of like a street address. How would you be able to get mail if your address weren't unique? These addresses are of the form **nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn**, where nnn is a number from 0-255 (2^8 - 1).

![Two computers connected to the Internet with unique IP addresses](https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper_files/ruswp_diag1.gif)

When you navigate to a url in your browser, how is this translated to a website on the world wide web? A special type of computer, called a server, is holding all of the data and files necessary to make that website work. When you navigate to a url, your request is routed to the appropriate server, which gives you back all of the data you need. These are all of the steps:
1. You enter a URL into your browser, e.g. https://neopets.com. This url is called a "domain name". 
2. The browser converts the domain name into an IP address using a DNS (Domain Name Server). This special type of server contains a database that maps domain names to IP address.
3. Your browser sends a HTTP request to the computer at the returned IP address. HTTP stands for Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol, and it is then language that browsers and web servers speak to each other in.
4. The web server sends back an HTTP response, containing the website's HTML (Hyper-text Markup Language) document. Every single website has an HTML document which contains the structure of the web page, and also lists any additional resources the browser needs to request.
5. Your browser starts rendering the HTML, converting the HTML code to visual elements, known as the DOM (Document Object Model).
6. Your browser requests any additional resources linked to in the HTML, i.e. images, videos, javascript files, css, and repeats steps 3-5.
7. Once the website is loaded, your browser executes any JavaScript scripts, which could things like modify the DOM or make additional HTTP requests.

There's a couple of other specifics about how requests and servers work. When computers communicate with each other over the Internet, they also communicate over specific ports. These are a number between 0-65535 (2^16 - 1). The port specifies which application or service to connect to on a server. Computers run lots of applications at once, so the port is crucial to knowing which one to connect to. Ports are appended to the end of an IP address, i.e. **nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn:pppp**. When you navigate to a website, often the port is implicit; for example, https://neopets.com:443 is the same as https://neopets.com. The IP address with the port, of the format nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn:pppp is called a **socket**. 

Applications that are running on a computer, that are waiting for HTTP requests on a specific port are called **web servers**. It's confusing that the word server can refer to a physical computer connected to the Internet, and also a piece of software that returns HTML/JavaScript/CSS/JSON/etc. In this class we will primarily be talking about servers as a software application. 

We will eventually be creating web servers that run on our own computers. How do we access them from a browser? Your local computer has a special IP address, **127.0.0.1**, which is aliased to "localhost". When we create these web servers, we'll give them a specific port too, usually something like 8000 or 8080.

### Modern Web Applications
- How are web applications structured? 
  - Front end - Code that runs in the browser. Typically consists of writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating interfaces for users to interact with
  - Back end - Code that runs on a server. This code consists of working with data and business logic. Could work in a variety of languages (in this class, JS running using Node.js), and interact with databases (in this class, MongoDB).
  - DevOps - 
- front end vs back end vs database vs hosting vs database hosting
- why build we build web applications / why not?
- what is a web *application* vs a website? (e.g. having database vs just static pages)


### Development Tools
- Development tools are applications that you work with in order to create web applications. 
- VSCode 
- showing hidden files and folders
- Command line (in VSCode vs Terminal application)
- Git (why?)
- HTML (using an index.html, linking to other files, using file urls)


### Web Development & Creative Practice
- how do different people use web development as part of their careers?
- guest speakers??
- web applications have many different uses and goals
- Profession web development vs using web development as a creative tool

### Vocabulary (example)
* Internet: a global network of computers connected to each other
