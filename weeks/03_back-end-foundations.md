# Week 03: Back-end Foundations

## Essential Questions

- What is the "back-end" / server-side programming?
- What is a server side programming language? How does it differ from client-side programming in the browser?
- What is Node.js? How does it relate to Express.js?
- What is an API? 
- What is REST?
- What is CRUD?
- How do we persist data? Can we persist data on a server without a database?
- What is the difference between server-side code and the server machine? How is this related to a platform-as-a-service (PaaS)?

## Introduction
This week we will be focusing our attention on server-side programming, otherwise known as the "back-end" of web applications.

### Outcomes & Goals

In this class we will be:
* Learning to program a server with Node.js
* Writing server-side JavaScript to create our own REST APIs that allow us to communicate between our client and server to perform CRUD operations.

Students will walk away with a deeper understanding of:
* The terminal / command-line
* NPM, Node.js and Express.js
* REST API structure
