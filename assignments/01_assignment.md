## Briefing

Your task this week is to code a simple website using basic HTML and CSS. The goal of this assignment is to begin your practice of the web development and deployment process.

Your assignment consists of two parts:
1. Setting up your development environment, making sure you've installed and set up
   * VSCode
   * git
   * GitHub Account
   * Glitch Account
   * [Generate an ssh key and add it to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
   * *Optional*: Customize your command line. Warning: This can be a black hole for your time. For example, Cassie uses [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) (an alternative to Terminal on MacOS), [Oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) (package manager for zsh), and [Starship](https://starship.rs/) (customizes your command prompt).
   * *Optional*: [Customize your VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/configure)
2. Creating, from scratch, a simple web page using only HTML, CSS, and media assets (images, videos, gifs, fonts, etc.). No JavaScript! You could make a page about your beloved pet, or maybe a work of hypertext art, fiction, or poetry. Try looking at [Rhizome's Artbase](https://rhizome.org/art/artbase/), specifically [Collection: Hypertext](https://rhizome.org/art/artbase/collections/collection-hypertext/) for inspiration.
