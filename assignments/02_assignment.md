## Requirements

Your assignment will be comprised of two parts:

### Part 1: Sketching, Wireframes, and Design specifications
Effective front end web development, is as about able to translate an interface or visual design into code and identifying how to combine content with layout, structure, and styling.

Part 1 of this assignment is about focusing on organizing **typography**, **layout**, and **color** *before* you start coding. We would like to see:

* 1. Annotated hand-drawn sketches of your layout and content
* 2. Wireframes that translate your hand-drawn sketches into a digital format
* 3. A "final" design that breathes life into your wireframes
* 4. Basic style guide that is specifies at the very least about your typographic hierarchy, your grid, and color palette and acts as your project's visual design source during development. 


### Part 2: Development

As a front end developer, your task is often to create faithful reproductions of the visual design of the web app/site that lands on your desk. Over time you will acquire new tips and tricks on how to make high fidelity recreations of the designs you've made or those that have been given to you. You will even be able to add delightful animations and add surprising effects that will tickle your users. 

For now, your job is to translate your own designs as faithfully as possible into code. In this step, you will identify how to take the specifications in your style guide and design (see part 1) and articulate them as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Here you will:
* 1. Create an HTML structure that best uses semantic HTML to structure your content
* 2. Define CSS rules that follow as best as possible BEM conventions that structure your layout and style your DOM elements
* 3. Write JavaScript that fulfills any (3) of the below interactive elements:
  * Selects the background of the website and changes it on button click (you'll have to add a button somewhere on your page... maybe in the navigation?).
  * ...
  * ...

* you must use BEM conventions to apply CSS classes

### Part 3: Deployment
Your website will be served using a static web server on **Glitch** and will be pulled from a remote Github repository. You will need to practice good git tracking and connect your local git repository to a remote Github Repository. 

You can copy the code from Assignment `01` from last week and put your static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files into the correct directories. 

**e.g.**:
* `index.html`
* `/views`:
  * `about.html`
* `/public`:
  * `/js`:
    * `main.js`
  * `/css`:
    * `main.css`
