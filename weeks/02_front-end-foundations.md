# Week 02: Front-end Foundations

## Exercises To Do Before Class
<!-- What materials (readings, tasks, exercises) should students complete before class to be prepared for the lesson. -->

* Introduction to the DOM: https://www.taniarascia.com/introduction-to-the-dom/
* Basic HTML File: https://www.taniarascia.com/basic-html5-file/
* Design for Developers: https://www.taniarascia.com/design-for-developers/

## Essential Questions

- How does the web browser work?
- What is the DOM? 
  - Why is it important to use semantically relevant tags instead of just "divs"?
- What are events? What are event listeners?
- How do we handle user inputs using HTML Forms? 
- What are the unique roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?
- What does it mean to be "asynchronous" in development? How and why is this relevant for web development?
- What is the CSS BEM system? and why is this important/helpful?
- What are JavaScript Array functions and how can they be used to achieve different tasks?


## Introduction
This week, we will be focusing our attention on the "front-end" of web applications. 


### Outcomes & Goals

In this class we will be:
* Learning about HTML5

Students will walk away with a deeper understanding of:
*  the DOM
*  CSS 
*  client-side JavaScript


## Topics
<!-- This section can have many subheaders (h3's). This should list all of the topic areas, (e.g. Git, Using the command line), with links to guides and references.  -->

### HTML & the DOM
- HTML is the content and structure
- The DOM 
- Accessibility and semantic HTML. TODO link to a guide for accessible HTML?
- Don't know which element to use? See [HTML Doctor](http://html5doctor.com/).

### CSS
- CSS is the styling and layout
- Cassie's experience learning CSS: "CSS is poorly designed, but you learn a few hacks to make it work for you."
- TODO: Design of website layout that we are working towards (Holy Grail? Other?)
- Using HTML to include CSS
- The Box Model
  - What are all the ways to change the size of a DOM element with CSS?
    - width
    - height
    - border
    - margin
    - padding
- TODO What CSS attributes should we talk about?
  - `box-sizing`: border-box or content-box?
- CSS Selectors: ids and css classes
- How to name classes? Using BEM (why BEM? specificity). ONLY USE CLASSES. 
- Using Developer Tools to Debug CSS
- Nice to think about:
  - css animations
  - pseudo-classes
  - keyframe animations
  - layouts:
    - block
    - flexbox
      - 1-D display
    - css grid:
      - 2-D layouts
- CSS Tips and Advice
  - Don't use floats for layout because they can be confusing. Only use them to wrap text around another element.
  - Only use classes (and sometimes tag names for more general styles) to apply styles to elements.
  - `vertical-align: middle` doesn't do what you think it does.
  - Almost always use `* { box-sizing: border-box }`
  - units: `em`, `rem`, `px` ==> I'd always go for `rem` if possible.

### JavaScript
- "Vanilla JavaScript"
- Selecting DOM Elements by DOM type or CSS class or ID
  - Accessing Elements in the DOM: https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-access-elements-in-the-dom/
  - Traversing the DOM: https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-traverse-the-dom/
  - Making Changes to the DOM: https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-make-changes-to-the-dom/
- Event binding / Event firing / listening
- Handling forms (only in the browser)
- `fetch`


### What we are not covering

NOTE: It should be noted that we are covering foundational knowledge of client side web development with HTML5. This is by no means a comprehensive deep dive into the intricacies and wonders of client side programming with HTML5, single page web applications, and front-end frameworks like Vue.js and React.js or build tools like Parcel and Webpack. Additionally we do not cover browser extensions or bookmarklets which are very exciting, but outside the scope of this course. 

Topics we are not covering, but are of importance:
* CSS Frameworks (i.e. Bootstrap, Semantic UI, Material)
* Front End JavaScript Frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)


## Pacing / Duration
- :30 Questions
<!-- Number of total hours the class session will take. Please try to take into account transition time between instruction and hands on exercises if any prep is necessary. -->
