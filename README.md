# Dynamic Web Development
**NYU, Interactive Telecommunications Program, Spring 2020**

**work in progress - plz ignore**

## Course Description

*Dynamic Web Development* introduces the fundamentals of building "full stack" web applications. This course will focus on modern, client- and server- side web technologies and provide practical methods for approaching web development for creative and functional applications. The core technologies used in this course are HTML5, JavaScript, Node.js with the Express framework, and MongoDB database. Students will learn to design, develop, and deploy web applications and gain the necessary skills to extend and explore web development independently. 

The course will be a mixture of lecture and in-class collaborative coding, with weekly programming and reading homework. 

## Objectives:
(forked from Sam Slover's API of you class)
By the end of the class, you should have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

* Full-Stack Javascript - Familiarity with both client-side and server-side Javascript.
* Designing Data-Driven Applications- How to design and build a 'full-stack' data application.
* Using APIs - How to interact with and use an API from within your client application.
* Structuring Data - How to intelligently structure data.
* Storing Data - How to build systems to store your own data.
* Building APIs - How to build your own APIs and make the data available to client applications.
* Deploying full stack applications - Deploying applications using Platforms-as-a-Service (PaaS) with Git/Github and Glitch.
