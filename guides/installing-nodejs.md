# Installing and Using Node.js with NVM

nvm, or Node Version Manager, is a tool for installing different versions of Node.js. Node.js updates happen quite frequently, and often times working on different Node projects requires using different versions of Node. You can instal Node using the [official installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) but it is recommended you use nvm. 

## Installing Node.js with NVM

### Mac or Linux
Simply copy and paste the following line into your terminal application and hit enter:
```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh | bash
```
and that's it!
