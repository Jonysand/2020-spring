# Assignment 1: Your first web server

## Briefing

Your task this week is to code from scratch a static web server to serve up a website you build about X. 

The goal of this assignment is to begin your practice of web development and to begin learning the syntax related to server-side JavaScript, HTML, and version control with Git.


In this assignment you will be:
1. writing your first server-side JavaScript using node.js and express.js to serve up a static HTML webpage.
2. using git to track your file changes as you develop your server code and client code
3. connecting your **local** *git repository* to a **remote** *Github repository*
4. deploying your static web server to Glitch.com - a platform-as-a-service. You will **connect** your *Github repository* to Glitch which will then use the server-side code and instructions as defined in your *GitHub repository* to configure a server machine (that lives on the Glitch platform) to serve up your static HTML webpage.

The simple workflow will look something like this:

```
Step 1: Local Development
write server code and HTML â†’ track changes using git 

â†“

Step 2: Connecting local git to Github
Create a new Github Repository on Github.com â†’ connect your local git repository to the remote Github repository

â†“

Step 3: On Glitch
Create a new project â†’ select: Clone from Git Repo â†’ input: https://github.com/yourUserName/yourAppName.git
```

Rinse and repeat!


## Requirements
* A web application deployed to the web following best practices. This means:
  * Your code and changes to your code must be well tracked using git
  * Your code must exist as a Github repository
  * You must `add`, `commit`, and `push` changes from your local development environment to your remote Github repository.
* You must have a README.md that explains:
  * how to set up your application. This includes, but is not limited to: how to install dependencies AND how to run your application
  * each step you took in building your server-side code
  * how you built your HTML page
  * and how your deployed your work to Glitch.
