# Dynamic Web Development
**NYU, Interactive Telecommunications Program, Spring 2020**

**work in progress**

## Course Description

*Dynamic Web Development* introduces the fundamentals of building "full stack" web applications. This course will focus on modern, client- and server- side web technologies and provide practical methods for approaching web development for creative and functional applications. The core technologies used in this course are HTML5, JavaScript, Node.js with the Express framework, and MongoDB database. Students will learn to design, develop, and deploy web applications and gain the necessary skills to extend and explore web development independently. 

The course will be a mixture of lecture and in-class collaborative coding, with weekly programming and reading homework. 

## Code of Conduct

* â†³ [Read the Code Of Conduct here](/CODEOFCONDUCT.md)


## Objectives:
(forked from Sam Slover's API of you class)
By the end of the class, you should have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

* Full-Stack Javascript - Familiarity with both client-side and server-side Javascript.
* Designing Data-Driven Applications- How to design and build a 'full-stack' data application.
* Using APIs - How to interact with and use an API from within your client application.
* Structuring Data - How to intelligently structure data.
* Storing Data - How to build systems to store your own data.
* Building APIs - How to build your own APIs and make the data available to client applications.
* Deploying full stack applications - Deploying applications using Platforms-as-a-Service (PaaS) with Git/GitHub, Glitch, and Heroku.

## Outcomes

In order to achieve these objectives, students will spend the semester building, refactoring, getting feedback and interating on, one project throughout the course. The interactive web application will require students to exercise each of the key skills taught throughout this course as well as equip students with the skills to continue developing new dynamic web applications after the course.
