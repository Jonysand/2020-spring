# Week 01: Web Foundations

## Essential Questions

- What are web applications?
- Why build web applications? Why to not build web applications? 
- What is the internet?
- What is a server? How is is different from a platforms-as-a-service? 
- What do we mean when we say the front-end (client side) vs. the back-end (server side) vs. devOps?
- How does communication work across the internet?


## Introduction
This week, we will be starting out journey as developers of the web. We will go through a quick history of the web and where are are today.  


### Outcomes & Goals

In this class we will be:
* gaining an appreciation for the web as a platform for making things
* setting up our development tools
* creating our very first webpages from scratch

Students will walk away with a deeper understanding of:
* the key concepts of "the web"


## Topics
<!-- This section can have many subheaders (h3's). This should list all of the topic areas, (e.g. Git, Using the command line), with links to guides and references.  -->

### How the Internet Works
- the Internet infrastructure
- Simplest concept: there's a computer and it has some code on it that tells it how to send and receive information (e.g. html files, images, videos, emails, etc).  


### Modern Web Applications
- front end vs back end vs database vs hosting vs database hosting
- why build we build web applications / why not?
- what is a web *application* vs a website? (e.g. having database vs just static pages)


### Development Tools
- VSCode 
- showing hidden files and folders
- Command line (in VSCode vs Terminal application)
- Git (why?)
- HTML (using an index.html, linking to other files, using file urls)
- Node.js (vs Browser, and why it exists)
- `npm`
- Express, serving files

### Web Development & Creative Practice
- how do different people use web development as part of their careers?
- guest speakers??
- web applications have many different uses and goals
- Profession web development vs using web development as a creative tool

## Materials Needed
<!-- What hardware, software, or other materials will students or teachers need for lessons. -->

* Laptop & Power charger
* Text Editor (VS Code)
* Web browser (chrome or firefox preferred, but safari is ok)
* GitHub Account
* Glitch Account

### Exercises To Do Before Class
<!-- What materials (readings, tasks, exercises) should students complete before class to be prepared for the lesson. -->

* Fill out the appropriate form based on your section:
  * Joey: 
  * Cassie:

### Vocabulary (example)
* term:
  * def...

## Studio Exercise Descriptions
<!-- Descriptions of each exercise or phase of class. Similar to pacing but with more description of steps. -->
- Setting up development environment

### Using a text editor
- Using VSCode

### Using Git and GitHub
- Installing git (how does this work on Windows??)
- Initializing a Git repository
- [Coding Train - Git and GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV)
- Documentation for deploying to Glitch.com from GitHub

### Node.js and the back end
- Downloading Node
- TODO: Should students download Node directly or use `nvm`?
- How to run a node script from the command line

### Using the command line
- TODO: how do you use unix on Windows??
- Using git
- Moving around directories

### Creating a static server with Node and Express
- [Example tutorial](https://alligator.io/nodejs/serving-static-files-in-express/), but maybe make our own

### Deploying to Glitch.com

Notes 

* Short history of the web?

* Blogs to follow
* What we are not going to learn in the class
  * list of topics/themes?
  * knowing what you know vs what you don't yet!
* Doing web development vs. working professionally as a developer vs. working professionally as a developer in industry vs. studio, etc
* Conceptual overview of how the web works?
* Overview of terms
* Clarification of terms
  * e.g. server vs platform as a service 
  * e.g. serverside javascript vs serverside XYZ
* The browser and the DOM
* Development tools 
  * git / github
  * text edior (vs code ) 
  * iterm2 or equivalent?
  * glitch account and/or heroku?

* Practice:
  * Git exercise + build a simple webpage
  * connecting github repo to glitch
  
* additional thoughts:
  * thinking about when to build from scratch vs. using templates. 
  * javascript patterns
    * think about state management, not polluting global scope, etc. 
    * e.g. pub-sub, MVC, MVVM, etc
